Laboratory work #7
Theme:		Working with collections in Java.
Objective:	Gaining skills in creating and using own standard collections in Java.

Task
1.	Determine 
	C2 as a remainder of division of the student record book by number 2, 
	C3 as a remainder of division of the student record book by number 3.


2.	Depending on C2 value determine the interface, which the collection implements:
	C2	Interface
	0	List
	1	Set

3.	Depending on C3 value determine the internal structure of the collection:
	C3	Internal structure of the collection
	0	An array with initial number of 15 elements and increase the number of items by 30%
	1	Linked list
	2	Double linked list

4.	Create a class that describes a typed collection (collection type is a generic class from the 6th laboratory work), that implements the interface given in option (item 2) and the internal structure given in option (p.3).
	Implement all methods of the interface and create at least three constructors:
		1 - empty 
		2 - in which is passed one generic object class 
		3 - in which is passed a standard collection of objects
	All initial data set in the executive method (main). 
	The code must conform to the JCC standards and be thoroughly documented.
