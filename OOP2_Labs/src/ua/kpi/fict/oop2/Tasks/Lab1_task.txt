Laboratory work #1
Create the class that consists of the executive method that performs the calculating of the function:
    S = SUM_i( SUM_j( (i OP2 j)/(i OP1 C) )[from b to m] )[from a to n]
with a defined type of indices (p.5),
operations (p.2 and p.4) {OP1 = "-", OP2 = "+" for record book #4103}
and constant (p.3).

The result of the action is a single valid-type value. 
You must process all exceptions that may occur during code execution.
All variables should be described and their values defined in the enforcement method.

	1.	Identify C2 as the remainder of the division of the student's record-book by number 2,
	C3 as the remainder of the division of the student record-book by 3,
	C5 as ... by 5, C7 as ... by 7.
			
	2.	Depending on the value of C2 determine the operation OP1:
C2	Operation OP1
0	+		
1	-		

	3.	Determine the constant C, which is equal to C3.		

	4.	Depending on the value of C5 determine the operation OP2:
C5	Operation OP2
0	*		
1	/		
2	%		
3	+		
4	-		

	5.	Depending on the value of C7 determine the type of indices i and j:		
C7	i and j type		
0	byte		
1	short		
2	int		
3	long		
4	char		
5	float		
6	double
